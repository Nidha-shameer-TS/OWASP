# OWASP-SCANNER

The OWASP Vulnerability Scanner is a lightweight web-based tool designed to identify common security vulnerabilities in HTML and JavaScript code snippets based on the OWASP Top 10 security risks.his project aims to promote secure coding practices among developers and students by providing instant feedback on potential flaws such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Injection attacks, Broken Access Control, Security Misconfiguration, and other critical issues. Users can paste their frontend code into the scanner, which then analyzes it using static analysis techniques, pattern matching, and open-source security libraries. The tool highlights unsafe coding patterns like the use of eval(), unsanitized inputs, open CORS policies, and hardcoded secrets. By detecting these vulnerabilities early, the scanner encourages developers to adopt more secure development habits and better understand the risks associated with insecure code. This project serves as both an educational tool and a basic security utility for small-scale applications.

## üì¶ Requirements

Install the following dependencies before running:

```bash
pip install flask flask-cors beautifulsoup4 lxml

## üíª How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the OWASP Vulnerability Scanner locally:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/owasp-scanner.git
cd owasp-scanner

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Backend Server
Navigate to the backend directory and run the Flask server:

```bash

cd backend
python app.py

### The backend will start at http://localhost:5000.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Frontend

Open the index.html file directly in your web browser:

On Windows: Double-click the index.html file.

On Mac/Linux: Right-click and choose ‚ÄúOpen with browser.‚Äù

Or you can drag and drop the file into your browser window.

# üìå Note: Make sure the backend is running before you test the frontend scanner!
